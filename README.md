Powerbi Second Assignment
Power BI Assignment: Comprehensive Data Analysis with DAX & Power Query
Objective:
Students will develop a Power BI report while learning:
• Power Query Editor (Data Transformation)
• Data Understanding & Preparation
• Data Modeling & Schema Design
• DAX Functions:
o Text Functions
o Logical Functions
o Time Intelligence Functions
• Dataset:
• Use the AdventureWorks Sales Dataset (CSV format) available on Kaggle
(Download Here) or an E-commerce Sales dataset from Kaggle.
Assignment Tasks
 Task 1: Understanding Power Query Editor (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
1. Import the dataset into Power BI using Power Query Editor.
2. Perform the following transformations:
o Remove missing values & duplicates.
o Change data types (e.g., Date, Currency, Categories).
o Split full names into first and last names.
o Merge tables based on keys (e.g., Orders & Customers).
3. Save a step-by-step documentation of transformations done.
Task 2: Understanding Data & Data Modeling
1. Identify key tables: Fact (Sales, Orders) and Dimension (Customers, Products, Regions).
2. Define Primary & Foreign Keys and create relationships in Model View.
3. Implement Star Schema for better performance.
4. Explain why schema design is important in a short document (1-2 pages).
Task 3: Implementing DAX Functions
A) Text Functions
Create calculated columns using the following Text DAX Functions:
1. Extract the first 3 letters of Product Category:
2. Create a full name column from First & Last Names:
B) Logical Functions
Use Logical DAX Functions for analysis:
1. Discount Category: Create a calculated column to categorize discounts
2. High-Value Customers:
C) Time & Intelligence Functions
Use Time Intelligence DAX Functions to analyze sales trends:
1. Calculate Total Sales Last Year:
2. Find Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales:
3. Calculate Month-over-Month Growth
Task 4: Data Visualization & Report Creation
 Create a Sales Dashboard:
• Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity (Cards)
• Sales Trends over time (Line Chart)
• Sales by Region & Product Category (Bar Chart)
• High-Value vs Regular Customers (Pie Chart)
 Create Customer Analysis Dashboard:
• Customer-wise sales & profits (Table)
• Top 10 Customers (Bar Chart)
• Discount Categories (Stacked Bar Chart)
 Add Filters & Slicers for dynamic interactivity.
Task 5: Submission Requirements
• Power BI Report (.pbix) File
• Step-by-step Documentation (for Power Query, Data Modeling, and DAX
